# CoronalHolesContour
MATLAB code for detection of solar coronal holes in SDO/AIA image using contour based methods.

## Detection of Coronal Holes Contour

For detection of coronal holes one need to download SDO/AIA 193 A jpeg images in 1024 resolution. Then follow one of the following instructions: 

Run demo_CoronalHolesContour.m in order to execute coronal holes detection.

Run DemoPORACM.m in order to execute coronal holes detection using only Parameterized Online Region-based Active Contour Method (POR-ACM).

Run DemoFCM.m in order to execute coronal holes detection using only Fast Fuzzy C-Means Clustering followed by Hough Transformed Simulated Static Contour Method (FFCM-SCM).

## Package Download

Download SDO/AIA 193 A jpeg images in 1024 resolution.

Download CoronalHolesContourDetection folder.

Go To -> Open for_testing folder -> Run CoronalHolesContourDetection.

For more help go through readme.txt.
