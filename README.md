# CoronalHolesContour
MATLAB code for detection of solar coronal holes in SDO/AIA image using contour based methods.

Run demo_CoronalHolesContour.m in order to execute coronal holes detection.

Run DemoPORACM.m in order to execute coronal holes detection using only Parameterized Online Region-based Active Contour Method (POR-ACM).

Run DemoFCM.m in order to execute coronal holes detection using only Fast Fuzzy C-Means Clustering followed by Hough Transformed Simulated Static Contour Method (FFCM-SCM).
